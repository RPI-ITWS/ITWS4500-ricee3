LAB 3 -

This lab was very annoying and challenging, I began trying to do the lab 3 that was actually given to us to complete and then I was told my classmates that the in class activity was an easy assignment. So on the 12th I decided to work on the in classactivity because my json in lab 3 was making me mad. I went and talked to Dr. Callahan about it but I could not figure it out for the life of me. The stock lab was much easier to understand and complete I think in my opinion. Overall, the hardest part was getting more stock info like I was more confused about the key I wanted to use MSFT and TSLA, so I am still trying to figure that out but I don't think we need more than 1, but I  could be wrong. Also I wasn't in class on friday because I had to get X-Rays done so I was confused in the beginning of this assignment since I wasn't able to attend class. But friends in the class helped me understand the work and document. I think what was the most confusing about this lab was figuring out what stock ID was needed to be implemented to test the code. This lab grabbed data from AAPL code and 


Creativty -
For creativity I decided to make the whole page turn into dark and light mode so it's easier for the users eyes. I know that bright white can hurt eyes of the users so that's why I implemented this idea. That was the only real creativity I did besides like the formatting of my HTML page. Also felt like the dark and light mode was an easy way to help everyone know what the creativity is an its something that is easy to use by everyone. Lastly, now everywhere there are light and dark modes, I don't think there is a single app now without the different modes, so I think I want to add those modes in every lab throughout the semester.

LAB 5 OPINION -

This lab was such a pain in the buttt omgggggg, I started off completely confused and didn't know where to start and then I started and did it all wrong.
Which I didn't know I was doing anything wrong up until I went to see Dr. Callahan, which he helped me out alot because it got me on track to understand what was going on.
Once I figured out what the heck I was supposed to do and complete I restarted the whole thing and started from lab 3 and 4. From there I got my collections and everything connected and then I had to work on the submit, save, delete, history and edit buttons which I finally completed. Overall, this lab sucked in my opinion but the only reason is because I had no idea what was going on in the beginning. Once I sat down and got help and figured it out I ended up doing good and getting it done quick.
