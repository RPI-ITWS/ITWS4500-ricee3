LAB 3 -

This lab was very annoying and challenging, I began trying to do the lab 3 that was actually given to us to complete and then I was told my classmates that the 
in class activity was an easy assignment. So on the 12th I decided to work on the in classactivity because my json in lab 3 was making me mad. I went and talked 
to Dr. Callahan about it but I could not figure it out for the life of me. The stock lab was much easier to understand and complete I think in my opinion. Overall, 
the hardest part was getting more stock info like I was more confused about the key I wanted to use MSFT and TSLA, so I am still trying to figure that out but I don't 
think we need more than 1, but I  could be wrong. Also I wasn't in class on friday because I had to get X-Rays done so I was confused in the beginning of this assignment 
since I wasn't able to attend class. But friends in the class helped me understand the work and document.


Creativty -
For creativity I decided to make the whole page turn into dark and light mode so it's easier for the users eyes. I know that bright white can hurt eyes of the users
so that's why I implemented this idea. That was the only real creativity I did besides like the formatting of my HTML page.
