## Lab 1

News API USED - https://developer.nytimes.com/apis

*Creativity* - 
My creativity was to make a light and dark mode for my website, I decided to have the light 
and dark mode in the top right of the page. And when clicked the whole background, text, and
box boarder will change for each mode.

_SPECIFICATIONS_
    - Color Scheme: Black and Grey
    - Scrolling: One big article at the top, 5 articles on screen at a time
    - How they cycle: Top article is the biggest and after a while it gets removing the articles below shift up one, adding a new article at the bottom
    - Additional styling: one big text box at the top, rest are smaller
    - Font: Times New Roman


_OVERALL_
First this assignment was a little annoying because I had everything all completed and 
everything was working but I had an API that was able to be used unlimited amounts without paying. Until
I went to my VM and it wasn't working on there, and I was super confused. Which, I then struggled to find me a good article to use
until I went to see Dr. Callahan and someone in his office told me to use NewYorkTimes. After I got that then the rest was smooth.
