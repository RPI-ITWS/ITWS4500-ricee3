LINK TO MY WEBSITE - http://ricee3.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/ITWS4500-ricee3/


News API USED - https://developer.nytimes.com/apis also used other random websites that fit into business, food, entertainment, tech, and sports.

*Creativity* - 
My creativity was to make a light and dark mode for my website, I decided to have the light and dark mode in the top right of the page. And when clicked the whole background, text, and box boarder will change for each mode.

$Thoughts -
In the beginning getting the API to connect to liveserver I found difficult but then I 
thought it was pretty smooth sailing. After I got it connected it was pretty easy because
all I had to do was connect my CSS, JSON, and Javascript. One thing I struggled with was
getting my CSS, JSON and JS connected to my html and Lab2server.js. I got my HTML to connect but everything else didn't want to connect, so I tried putting everything in my HTML page and everything started to work, so thats what I ended up doing. Which on the lab document it didn't say I couldn't put my CSS, JS and JSON into my HTML page. There wasn't much more to really add, so I kept the creativity pretty similar to lab 1.
