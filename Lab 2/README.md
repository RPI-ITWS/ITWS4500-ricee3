LINK TO MY WEBSITE - http://ricee3.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/ITWS4500-ricee3/
(local) localhost:3000

News API USED - https://developer.nytimes.com/apis also used other random websites that fit into business, food, entertainment, tech, and sports. 
https://www.cnbc.com/rss-feeds/, https://www.etonline.com/rss, https://www.espn.com/espn/news/story?page=rssinfo, https://www.bonappetit.com/story/rss-feeds

*Creativity* - 
My creativity was to make a light and dark mode for my website, I decided to have the light and dark mode in the top right of the page. 
And when clicked the whole background, text, and box boarder will change for each mode. Also each source of news is for a different topic, the first is Business,
then food, tech, sports, and entertainment. So all the articles are filtered through those topics. Made it so that the title would also be linked to the website, so if someone wants to visit the website all they have to do is click the title.

*Thoughts* -
In the beginning getting the API to connect to liveserver I found difficult but then I 
thought it was pretty smooth sailing. After I got it connected it was pretty easy because
all I had to do was connect my CSS, JSON, and Javascript. One thing I struggled with was
getting my CSS, JSON and JS connected to my html and Lab2server.js. I got my HTML to connect but everything else didn't want to connect, so I tried putting everything in my HTML page and everything started to work, so thats what I ended up doing. Which on the lab document it didn't say I couldn't put my CSS, JS and JSON into my HTML page. There wasn't much more to really add, so I kept the creativity pretty similar to lab 1.
