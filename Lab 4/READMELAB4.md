WORK LOG -
- 2/13: Started in class, first day with react
- 2/23: Worked more in class, got my front-end working
- 2/24: Got like half of the content done like submit to work and get all the last, ask and mid prices to work
- 2/25: Pretty much got everything working, save, delete, edit and history, also got the stock prices to display correctly again after messing with it


OVERVIEW OF LAB -

Overall this lab was kinda annoying at first because getting the frontend info over to react was 
easy but then doing all the backend stuff was very annoying in my opinion. It was annoying because
all the frontend stayed the save and you didn't have to change really anything around which was nice 
and easy but then backend you kinda had to rework everything to work again for the same application. 
Also, throughout the lab I had to keep going back onto Node to make sure that my info on this lab was
working the same as it was on my lab 3 becaue I forgot how everything was supposed to function. I'm not
a fan of react tbh, although I think that I liked react more than Node because Node was the most annoying thing ever.



CREATIVITY -
My creativity throghout my website is getting the website to switch from light to dark mode whenever the button is click.
Onces the button is clicked the whole website information switches to the preference of the user. They can always switch back
and forth whenever they like.
