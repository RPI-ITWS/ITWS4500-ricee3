This section of the lab was pretty straightforward and easy to understand because it was 
similar to the stocks lab that we did for lab 3. I pretty much used lab 3 as a reference the whole time
I used similar information and data that I used in lab 3 stocks. For creativity I used dark and light mode, 
I've used light and dark mode on a lot of my labs because it's easy now to implement especially when I am
being timed. I easily implemented that into this website for bored activity api. So when you click light it 
shows light purple and then when you click dark mode it shows dark purple.
